    description1: "Hello - Nancy here! I'm passionate about software development, data analytics, and robotics.",
    description2: "I'm a junior at Tufts University, currently  studying Computer Science and Mathematics. A project that I'm currently working on is a Bill Splitting Tool. The inspiration behind this project was when my friends and I visited Costco, where everything is sold in bulk. Since each item was split differently between the 11 of us, I decided to start this project to make future shopping easier. Other than this, I love to read fantasy books, play video games (Claire Obscure: Expedition 33, at the moment), and go on weekly runs with my friends.",
